# Dash DAQ Satellite Dashboard

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application, and
is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code. To learn more about Dash, check out our
[documentation](https://dash.plot.ly/).

## About the app

A Dash application that simulates satellite tracking and displays live data captured by them.

### Satellite

Artificial satellites are objects placed into orbit for various tasks, such as surveillance and transferring radio data
across the world. It's important to monitor satellites to ensure that they can accomplish their jobs, so information such as
their position and elevation are, for example, useful to determine whether or not a satellite is deviating from its original path
due to unforeseen circumstances.

### Dash-DAQ

[Dash-DAQ](http://dash-daq.netlify.com/#about) is a data acquisition and control package built on top of Plotly's
[Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/). It comprises a robust set of controls that make it simpler to integrate data
acquisition and controls into your Dash applications.

Try out the [demo app here](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-daq-satellite-dashboard/).
