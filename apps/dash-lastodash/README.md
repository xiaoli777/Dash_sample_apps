# LAStoDash

## About this app

LAStoDash is a sample Dash project that takes a [Log ASCII Standard (LAS) file](http://www.cwls.org/las/) and builds a web app to view its content and print in PDF format.

As indicated in the [LAS 2.0 Specifications](http://www.cwls.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Las2_Update_Feb2017.pdf), LAS files contain sections that are marked by a ~. The [LAS file](alcor1.las) used for this app contains four of these sections, including version and wrap mode information (~V), well identification (~W), curve information (~C), and ASCII log data (~A), all of which are displayed in some format (e.g. graph, table) in the demo app and the [printable report in PDF format](alcor1.pdf).
